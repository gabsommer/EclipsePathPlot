# EclipsePathPlot
Calculates and animtes path of penumbra and umbra of moon during solar eclipses. Integrates coupled differential equations of newtonian 5 body problem (Venus,Sun,Jupiter,Earth,Moon) using Runge-Kutta-4 and does rudimentary raytracing to calculate path of shadow across hemisphere. Written from scratch in C++ for personal educational purposes.

Only depends on the "Eigen" library.
